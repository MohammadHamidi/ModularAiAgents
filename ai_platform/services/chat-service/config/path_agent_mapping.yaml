# Pattern matching rules:
# 1. Exact matches are tried first
# 2. Then wildcard matches (longest prefix first)
# 3. Finally, default agent is used

# Examples:
#   /konesh/list              → action_expert
#   /profile/complete         → journey_register
#   /rewards/history          → rewards_invite
#   /unknown-page             → guest_faq (default)
